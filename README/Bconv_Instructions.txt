BCONV 1.1 - Instructions
------------------------

Platform: HP49G
Language: UserRPL
Version: 1.1 
Checksum: # C7BFh
Bytes: 1933.

Description:
This program converts a number on base A to base B, where 2 <= {A, B} <= 36. 
The program supports decimal arithmetic on inputs and outputs. It will display all digits.  

The base conversion algorithm used is as follows: 

To convert a number N from base A to base B, 
  (a) The series substitution method with base 10 arithmetic is used to convert N from base A to base 10, and
  (b) the radix divide or multiply with decimal arithmetic is used to convert N from base 10 to base B.

Installation: 
Just send the file BCONV to the calculator in binary mode to HOME or any subdirectory you want. 

Usage: (assumes RPN mode)  
There are two ways to input the number to convert on the stack: as a regular number (integer or real) or as a string. The string input becomes useful for bases > 10 and/or when entering real numbers with more than 12 digits.    
The program requires 3 numbers on the stack as inputs. Enter the number, N followed by the current base and finally the base you want the number to be converted to.   

Example:
4123.0563			"-95CE4.23A"
7				18
15				5

Output

b7:4123.0563			b18:"-95CE4.23A"
b10:"1438.120783007081"		b10:"-978088.122085048011"
b15:"65D.1C2998E1794A"		b5:"-222244323.030112242134"

Note:
The intermediate base 10 of N is always displayed. 
If you enter non-integers base values, only the integer portion will be considered.
